# ItemBlacklist
A spigot plugin that prevents players from owning and placing illegal items!

Permissions:

-ItemBlacklist.Items.bypass: bypass inventory scans

-ItemBlacklist.Blocks.bypass: be able to place blacklisted blocks

Edit blacklisted items and blocks in config.yml. With blacklisted blocks, be aware you have to add all types of the block, e.g. 'torch' and 'wall_torch' or 'player_head' and 'player_wall_head'.

ItemBlacklist works with PerWorldInventory, but it only checks the player's active inventory.
