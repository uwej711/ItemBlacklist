# ItemBlacklist
A spigot plugin that prevents players from owning and placing illegal items!

Permissions:

  -ItemBlacklist.Items.bypass:
    bypass inventory scans
   
  -ItemBlacklist.Blocks.bypass:
    be able to place blacklisted blocks
    
Edit blacklisted items and blocks in config.yml. With blacklisted blocks, be aware you have to add all types of the block, e.g. 'torch' and 'wall_torch' or 'player_head' and 'player_wall_head'.

It is not reccomended to use this plugin with other plugins that mess with inventories, e.g. PerWorldInventory or Multiverse, as i don't know what it will do when several inventories exist for a player.
